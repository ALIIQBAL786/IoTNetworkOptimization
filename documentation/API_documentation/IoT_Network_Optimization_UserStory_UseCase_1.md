|Summary|A Service Provider partners with a Telco Operator to deploy IoT devices (e.g., sensors, trackers) across the Telco’s nationwide cellular network. To ensure prolonged device battery life and operational efficiency, the Service Provider seeks to activate power-saving configurations for its IoT fleet during periods of low activity or based on predefined thresholds. The Service Provider’s management system invokes the IoT Network Optimization API to dynamically adjust network connectivity parameters. This includes optimizing data transmission intervals, reducing signal strength during idle phases, and scheduling sleep cycles for devices without disrupting critical service functionality. The API evaluates network conditions, device locations, and application requirements to apply energy-efficient settings while maintaining guaranteed quality-of-service levels. By leveraging the API, the Provider ensures IoT devices consume minimal power during operation, significantly extending battery lifetimes and reducing energy costs. The optimization accounts for both device-level energy savings and reduced overhead on the Telco’s network infrastructure (e.g., lower RAN utilization during sleep cycles). Clients benefit from uninterrupted service with no manual intervention, aligning sustainability goals with operational reliability.| M |
